# No PDF Download

## New functionality
Added a popup UI and an option to whitelist several URLS. Compatible with both Firefox and Chrome (for now) using manifest 2.

While most PDF files can be viewed directly in the browser some PDFs will trigger a "Save as"-dialog or will be downloaded automatically. This addon views all PDF files directly in the browser. You can still save the PDF by pressing CTRL+S (or CMD+S) after viewing them.
